# My Grunt Email Workflow

[![Built with Grunt](https://cdn.gruntjs.com/builtwith.png)](http://gruntjs.com/)

### This is a Email Workflow built with the GRUNT Taskrunner and inspired by [leemunroe's](http://https://github.com/leemunroe/grunt-email-workflow) repository [grunt-email-workflow](http://https://github.com/leemunroe/grunt-email-workflow).


With this workflow you can automate some parts of your email workflow like testing your email on different email clients with [Litmus]('https://litmus.com/') 


#### Getting Started with Grunt

##### 1. Install the GRUNT CLI (command line interface), in order to install this you first need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), if you don't have it installed yet. Go to their website and follow the steps. Run the following command. The -g flag will install the GRUNT CLI globally so you will only need to run this command once. 

```sh
npm install -g grunt-cli
```

##### 2. Create a new directory / folder in which you are going to work in.
##### 3. Create a package.json file. You can do it manually or you can just run the following command:

Go to your directory / folder
```sh
cd /user/yourpath
```

```sh
npm init
````

```sh
name: (name-of-your-folder) 
````

Just type in a name

```sh
version: (1.0.0) 
````

Give it a version


```sh
description
`````

Type in a description

```sh
entry point: (index.js)
````

Type in an entry point or leave it blank

```sh
test command: 
````

Type in a test command or leave it empty


```sh
git repository: 
````
Fill in a git repository or leave it blank


```sh
keywords:
```

Type in some keywords or leave it empty

```sh
author: 
````

Fill in the author or leave it empty

```sh
license: 
```
Give it a license or leave it empty

```sh
Is this ok? (yes) 
```
Type yes

And now you will see that a package.json has been created in your folder

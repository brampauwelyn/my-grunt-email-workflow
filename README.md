# My Grunt Email Workflow

[![Built with Grunt](https://cdn.gruntjs.com/builtwith.png)](http://gruntjs.com/)

### This is a Email Workflow built with the GRUNT Taskrunner and inspired by [leemunroe's](http://https://github.com/leemunroe/grunt-email-workflow) repository [grunt-email-workflow](http://https://github.com/leemunroe/grunt-email-workflow).

#### Getting Started with Grunt

1. Install the GRUNT CLI (command line interface), in order to install this you first need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), if you don't have it installed yet. Go to their website and follow the steps. Run the following command. The -g flag will install the GRUNT CLI globally so you will only need to run this command once. 

```
npm install -g grunt-cli
```
